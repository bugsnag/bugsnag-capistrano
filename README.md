# Bugsnag deploy tracking with Capistrano

Bugsnag Capistrano automatically notifies Bugsnag when you deploy your
application with [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano),
allowing to correlate deploys with new errors and increased error rates in
Bugsnag.

It also includes a Rake task for manually sending deploy notifications or
for projects not using Capistrano.

[Bugsnag](http://bugsnag.com) captures errors in real-time from your web,
mobile and desktop applications, helping you to understand and resolve them
as fast as possible. [Create a free account](http://bugsnag.com) to start
capturing exceptions from your applications.
